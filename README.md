In soccer, teams will pay massive amounts of money for players they think are good. I want to put an actual number to how good these players are and if teams are getting their moneys worth. I want to take stats of players from before their big money transfer and after. I want to see if how much these teams are paying for goals, assits, clean sheets, and minutes played. I'm curious to how much these stats are worth to teams. My hypothesis is that the dollar per stat varies significantly and that teams pay big money for the name. I would get my data from several league websites, wikipedia, and other sites with information I am looking for.

Who hires data scientist? I want to scrap job searching websites and categorize what type of companies are hiring us. I want to see what level they are looking for and their educational requirements.
